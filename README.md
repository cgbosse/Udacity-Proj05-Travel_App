# Repository Description

This repo for the 5th project for the Udacity Front End Developer  project.

For the project we had to create a simple Travel app where you entered a date and destination and it pulls in some pictures and information of interest such as the weather. In addition a counter of the pending dates until the trips date.

The goal of this project was get additional practice with:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

## Repository Branches

- Each repository branch reflects the different stages or progress to complete the requirements.  
- I reused code from my passed projects such as project 3 and 4 which I incorporated and adapted for this project.

__Notes:__  

- During the process of creating these I came to conclude that some of the previously generated code was not needed, so that will find some code that is not existant at later branches.  
- In order to run the code you will require node version 11.15.0 and nvm version 1.1.8.
- Also you will have to create a .env file with your API Keys for the different APIs.

## Available Documentation

Here you will find detailed information as to the steps and notes from the Udacity course that had to be implemented in addition some commands I hade to use repetitively.

## Greatest Challenges

1. Understanding async function and promise chaining.  
2. Understanding that I had to use the right node.js and npm versions.
3. Understanding that I had to downgrade the different package versions of plugins and loaders and not just install the latest versions which are installed by default.
4. Realizing that we did not have to follow exactly the boiler plate api fetch template from MeaningCloud.
5. Learning to do testing.
6. Incorporating new features.
